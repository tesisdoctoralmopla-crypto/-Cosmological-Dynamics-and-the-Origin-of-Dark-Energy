Overview 

This paper extends Constitutive Quantum Field Theory (CQFT) into cosmology, demonstrating that dark energy and cosmic acceleration emerge naturally from the same quantum field responsible for modified gravity and the elimination of dark matter in Papers I and II. 

CQFT proposes a single complex scalar field, Φ, with U(1) symmetry broken at the Grand Unification scale (v ≈ 10¹⁷ GeV), as determined by galactic rotation curves. This framework resolves the two pillars of the standard cosmological model’s crisis: 

    Dark Energy as Vacuum Energy: The field’s symmetry-breaking potential generates an effective cosmological constant directly tied to the GUT scale and the macroscopic coupling β ≈ 8.3 × 10⁻⁵.
    Dark Energy as Quintessence: The Nambu-Goldstone boson (χ) associated with the broken symmetry exhibits dynamical behavior, tracking matter density at high redshift and transitioning to a cosmological-constant-like state at late times.
     

Key Achievements 

    Unified Origin: Dark matter (explained via modified gravity) and dark energy (via vacuum energy + quintessence) arise from a single, high-energy quantum field.
    Parameter-Free Prediction: The dark energy sector is not freely fitted; its strength is fixed by β, constrained independently by galactic dynamics.
    Falsifiable Predictions: CQFT predicts a unique, scale-dependent enhancement of gravitational growth at intermediate cosmological scales, distinct from ΛCDM. This signature is testable via:
        Weak lensing (convergence power spectrum)
        Redshift-space distortions (growth rate fσ₈)
        BAO and CMB (constraining the transition from tracking to freezing)
         
    Resolution of the Coincidence Problem: The near-equality of dark matter and dark energy densities today is a natural consequence of the field’s dynamical tracking behavior, not fine-tuning.
     

Significance 

CQFT III presents a radical, unified alternative to ΛCDM. It replaces two unexplained, free parameters (dark matter and dark energy) with one well-motivated, high-energy mechanism. The theory is highly constrained and makes specific, testable predictions for next-generation cosmological surveys. Its survival depends on whether future data reveals the predicted scale-dependent growth enhancement or the transition dynamics of the constitutive field. 
 

Note: This is Paper III in the CQFT series. Paper I established phenomenological gravity. Paper II derived β and the quantum collapse mechanism. Paper IV will embed the U(1) symmetry within a full GUT.
